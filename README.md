# Landing-page-project

This project is a practice project where I practiced all the different things related to html and css manipulation that I have learnt over the past month.

The goal of this project was to be able to bridge the gap between ideas and execution, to be able to think of a layout of a webpage and be able to structure it and then execute it the way I envisioned it in the beginning.

This is the planned layout and structure I was attempting to build:

And this is what I built:
